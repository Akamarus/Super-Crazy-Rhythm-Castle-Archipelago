# Super Crazy Rhythm Castle Archipelago

Unofficial Archipelago integration for **Super Crazy Rhythm Castle**.

This repository contains both halves of the implementation:

- `client/` — BepInEx/IL2CPP C# client plugin used inside the game.
- `apworld/` — Archipelago world definition and generation logic.
- `docs/` — progression design, permanent network-ID registry, testing notes, and repository workflow.
- `tools/` — local validation and APWorld packaging helpers.

## Current baseline

| Component | Version | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Client | `0.67.59` | Current tested baseline |
| APWorld | `0.15` | Current tested baseline; Roots forced starter |
| Archipelago implementation tag | `area-routing-plant-pipes-0.15` | Current slot-data implementation |

Current Roots progression includes randomized **Weed Killer** and **Plant Pipes**, plus the Frog/Hippo in-level AP check. The first Roots arrival cutscene is bypassed for AP routing, and the campaign-order Star Eater blockade / FirstAreaGate are normalized while Roots Access is owned.

## Development disclaimer

The implementation is being developed with AI-generated code under human direction. Design decisions, game logic, test plans, gameplay verification, and acceptance/rejection of changes are driven by the project owner; code and documentation are largely generated and iterated with AI assistance.

## Build the client

The client references BepInEx and IL2CPP interop assemblies from the local game installation. **Do not commit those DLLs to this repository.**

From PowerShell:

```powershell
cd .\client
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\build.ps1 -GameDir "D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Titus"
```

The script builds the plugin and installs it into:

```text
<GameDir>\BepInEx\plugins\RhythmCastleAP
```

## Build the APWorld

From the repository root:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\tools\build-apworld.ps1
```

The generated file is written to:

```text
dist\scrc.apworld
```

Install that file in Archipelago's `custom_worlds` directory and generate a fresh seed when APWorld data changes.

## Validate before committing

```powershell
python .\tools\validate-repo.py
```

This validates the APWorld Python syntax, metadata, committed ID frontier, key progression mappings, and repository layout without requiring an Archipelago installation.

## Repository rules

1. Never reuse an existing or historical Archipelago item/location ID. See [`docs/IDS.md`](docs/IDS.md).
2. Do not commit game DLLs, BepInEx binaries, generated plugin binaries, runtime logs, or generated `.apworld` files.
3. Preserve meaningful vanilla progression instead of replacing it with generic unlock flags when possible.
4. Keep AP reachability logic consistent with what the client can actually do in-game.
5. Update `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/IDS.md`, and `docs/PROGRESSION.md` when a milestone changes them.

## Current development direction

Roots is intentionally forced as the starter while its progression chain is being implemented and audited. The next planned discovery is the **Level 4 glasses → Minim trade → Chicken Bucket** chain. Randomized Star requirements come after the meaningful item/story prerequisites are mapped correctly.

See [`docs/PROGRESSION.md`](docs/PROGRESSION.md) for the current logic model.
